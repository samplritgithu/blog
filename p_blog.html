        <h1>What is Python</h1>
        <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

            It is used for:
            
            web development (server-side),
            software development,
            mathematics,
            system scripting.
            Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way</p>
<h1>Python Comments</h1>
<p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.

    Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
    
    Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
    Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
    A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:
    Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

    To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

    Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:</p>
<h1>Python Variables</h1>
<p>Variables are containers for storing data values.

    Creating Variables
    Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    
    A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
    Variable Names
    A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</p>
    <h1>Python Data Types</h1> 
    <p>Built-in Data Types
        In programming, data type is an important concept.
        
        Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
        
        Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
        
        Text Type:	str
        Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
        Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
        Mapping Type:	dict
        Set Types:	set, frozenset
        Boolean Type:	bool
        Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
        None Type:	NoneType
        Getting the Data Type
        You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:</p>
        <h1>Python Numbers</h1> 
        <p>There are three numeric types in Python:

            int
            float
            complex
            Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
            Int
            Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
            Float
            Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.</p>
            <h1>Python Strings</h1> 
            <p>Strings
                Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
                
                'hello' is the same as "hello".
                
                You can display a string literal with the print() function:
                
                Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

                However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

                Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.</p>
