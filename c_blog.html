        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen or in
            other media
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages
            all at once
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>
            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>CSS was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the
                time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.Style sheets have
                existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized
                Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide
                style sheets for the web</p>
                <h1>ADVANTAGES</h1>
                <P>Easier to maintain and update.
                    Greater consistency in design.
                    More formatting options.
                    Lightweight code.
                    Faster download times.
                    Search engine optimization benefits.
                    Ease of presenting different styles to different viewers.
                    Greater accessibility</P>
                    <h1>CSS SELECTORS</h1>
                    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want
                        to style.
                        We can divide CSS selectors into :CSS Element Selector
                        CSS ID Selector
                        CSS Class Selector
                        CSS Universal Selector
                        CSS Grouping Selecto</p>
                        <h1>CSS ELEMENT Selectors</h1>
                        <p>The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
                            Example
                            Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text
                            color:
                            p {
                             text-align: center;
                             color: red;
                            }</p>
                            <h1>CSS ID Selectors</h1>
                            <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specificelement.
                                The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to
                                select one unique element!
                                To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followedby the id of the element.
                                Example
                                The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1":
                                #para1 {
                                 text-align: center;
                                 color: red;
                                }</p>
                                <h1>CSS CLASS Selectors</h1>
                                <p>The CSS class Selector
                                    The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
                                    To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character,
                                    followed by the class name.
                                    Example
                                    In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and
                                    center-aligned:
                                    .center {
                                    text-align: center;
                                     color: red;
                                    }</p>
                                    <h1>The CSS Grouping Selector</h1>
                                    <p>The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
                                        For Example:
                                        h1, h2, p {
                                        text-align: center;
                                        color: red;
                                        }
                                        <body>
                                        <h1>Hello World!</h1>

                                        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                                        </body>
                                        </html></p>
                                        <h1>CSS universal Selectors:</h1>
                                        <p>The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
                                            example:
                                            * {
                                            text-align: center;
                                            color: blue;
                                            }</p>

                                                body {
                                                background-color: lightblue;
